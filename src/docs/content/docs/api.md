Source code for all the REST resources can be found from package io.cassandrareaper.resources.

## Login Resource

* **POST     /login**
  * Expected form parameters:  
  		* *username*: User to login with as defined in Shiro settings (default user is **admin**)

  * Expected query parameters: *None*
  * Returns a JWT to use in all REST calls when authentication is turned on in Reaper. 
The token must be passed in the `Authorization` HTTP header in the following form:

```  
This operation expects that a call was previously made to `/login` and that the retrieved session id is passed in the cookies when requesting a JWT.
