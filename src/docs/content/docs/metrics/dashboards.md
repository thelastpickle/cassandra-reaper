## Dashboards

There are many ways of visualising the metrics Reaper exposes. Here is just a few examples to get you started. 

We are going to use Grafana to visualize metrics fetched from a Prometheus backed. We will also assume the metrics were [relabeled](../prometheus). 


### Repair progress

One of the simplest things to visualize is repair progress. We can do that using a simple `Gauge`, where we use use the following query:
```
io_cassandrareaper_service_RepairRunner_repairProgress
```

To make the panel more pretty, we can enter the following in the `Legend` field:
```
{{cluster}} - {{keyspace}}
```

With two keyspaces doing repairs, we should see two dials, one for each keyspace:

{{< screenshot src="/img/simple_gauge.png" />}}

We can now switch the `Gauge` visualisation for a `Stat` one, which will give us the repair progress, but also a small graph showing the progress over time:

{{< screenshot src="/img/simple_stat.png" />}}

To monitor the repair progress in terms of the number of repaired segments, we can use the following query:

```
io_cassandrareaper_service_RepairRunner_segmentsDone
```

Again, we put this query into the `Stat` panel, but we also select `Last` for the `Calc` field in the `Display` part of the `Visualization` tab. We should get a chart that looks like this:

{{< screenshot src="/img/segments_done.png" />}}


### Segment duration 

When monitoring repairs, we would like to know how much time it takes to repair a segment. As a rule of thumb, we would like each segment to take 10 to 15 minutes. This indicates the segments are big enough to not waste the overhead of a repair session and minimise over-streaming, while not being too large to risk streaming timeouts. 

To check segment durations, we will use the `SegmentRunner_runRepair` metric. This metric is a timer covering the duration from the moment a `SegmentRunner` wakes up to repair a segment until the segment finishes. In this case, we will use a `Graph` and feed it the following querry:

```
io_cassandrareaper_service_SegmentRunner_repairing{quantile="0.5"}
```

Unlike previous examples, here we add a filter to explicitly pick the `0.5`th percentile because we are interested in the majority of the segments, not just the longest ones. Reaper already gives us this duration in seconds, so we pick `Seconds (s)` as a `Unit` for the `Left Y` axis in the `Axes` section of the Visualization tab. We should end up with a graph that looks like this:

{{< screenshot src="/img/segments_duration.png" />}}

We see our segments are taking ~30 seconds, which is way below the desired ~10 minutes. We should tweak our repairs to use less segments.

### Segments per hour

For the last two graphs, we'll try something harder. We'll try to plot the number of segments repaired per hour.

We create another `Graph` panel and feed it a query like this:

```
(increase(io_cassandrareaper_service_RepairRunner_segmentsDone[1h]))
```

The above simply means we ask Prometheus to give us the increase of the given metric in a 1 hour window. 

Next, we enter `1h` as a `Min step` in the query tab (it's next to the `Legend` field), and we set `24h` as a `Relative time`. In the `Visualization` tab, we select to draw `Bars` and turn on stacking. We should end up with a graph like this:

{{< screenshot src="/img/segments_per_hour.png" />}}

Note that the panel now says it tracks the last 24 hours in the top right corner - this is because of the relative time we selected. Also, even though it's not obvious from the graph, Grafana will draw a bar only after that hour passes. In other words, you might need to wait a bit before you start to see your bars.

### Segments in the last hour

Finally, we can also plot the number of segments repaired in the last hour only. We use the same query, `min step` and `Relative time` as before, but this time we put it into a `Bar Gauge` with a vertical orientation. We should see this:

{{< screenshot src="/img/segments_last_hour.png" />}}
