Enter an address of one of the nodes in the cluster, then click *Add Cluster* Reaper will contact that node and find the rest of the nodes in the cluster automatically.

Once successfully completed, the Cluster's [health](../health) will be displayed.

If JMX authentication is required and all clusters share the same credentials, they have to be filled in the Reaper YAML file, under `jmxAuth` (see the [configuration reference](../../configuration/reaper_specific)).
  

## Specific JMX credentials per cluster

_**Since 1.1.0**_

If the clusters require authentication for JMX access, credentials will need to be filled in the reaper yaml configuration file. See the `jmxCredentials` setting in the [configuration reference](../../configuration/reaper_specific) for detailed informations.

When using `jmxCredentials` (if each cluster has specific credentials), the name of the cluster will need to be indicated in the seed node address.
