      <description>Astra Backend To use Astra (Cassandra managed service by Datastax) as the persistent storage for Reaper, the storageType setting must be set to astra in the Reaper configuration YAML file. In addition, the connection details for the Astra cluster being used to store Reaper data must be specified in the configuration YAML file. An example of how to configure Astra as persistent storage for Reaper can be found in the cassandra-reaper-astra.</description>

      <description>In-Memory Backend To use in memory storage as the storage type for Reaper, the storageType setting must be set to memory in the Reaper configuration YAML file. Note that the in memory storage is enabled by default. An example of how to configure Reaper with In-Menory storage can be found in the cassandra-reaper-memory.yaml.
storageType: memory In-memory storage is volatile and as such all registered cluster, column families and repair information will be lost upon service restart.</description>

      <description>Core Concepts Segments Reaper splits repair runs in segments. A segment is a subrange of tokens that fits entirely in one of the cluster token ranges. The minimum number of segments for a repair run is the number of token ranges in the cluster. With a 3 nodes cluster using 256 vnodes per node, a repair run will have at least 768 segments. If necessary, each repair can define a higher number of segments than the number of token ranges.</description>

      <description>Authentication Authentication is activated in Reaper by default. It relies on Apache Shiro, which allows to store users and password in files, databases or connect through LDAP and Active Directory out of the box. The default authentication uses the dummy username and password as found in the default shiro.ini. It is expected you override this in a production environment.
This default Shiro authentication configuration is referenced via the following block in the Reaper yaml file :</description>

      <description>Forward Merging Reaper practices forward merging commits.
Fixes and improvements required to release branches are first committed to those branches. These changes are merged forward onto master afterwards.
An example where a bugfix developed and approved for the release branch 1.4 is to be merged;
# first rebase the work one last time off the latest 1.4 branch git checkout bob/1.4_bugfix git rebase 1.4 git push # switch to the 1.</description>

      <description>Building Install Packages Debian packages and RPMs can be built from this project using Make, for example:
make deb make rpm Building JARs from source To build use the following command:
mvn clean package Building Docker Image from source See the Docker section for more details.
Building Using Docker To simplify the build toolchain it&amp;rsquo;s possible to build everything using Docker itself. This is the process used to build the release binary artifacts from jar files to debian packages.</description>

      <description>Dashboards There are many ways of visualising the metrics Reaper exposes. Here is just a few examples to get you started.
We are going to use Grafana to visualize metrics fetched from a Prometheus backed. We will also assume the metrics were relabeled.
Repair progress One of the simplest things to visualize is repair progress. We can do that using a simple Gauge, where we use use the following query:</description>

      <description>Graphite Reporter Reaper can be configured to periodically report metrics to a Graphite host. This can be done using the following properties in the Reaper configuration YAML file.
Metrics: frequency: 1 minute reporters: - type: graphite host: &amp;lt;host_address&amp;gt; port: &amp;lt;port_number&amp;gt; prefix: &amp;lt;prefix&amp;gt; Where:
 host_address is hostname of the Graphite server to report to. port_number is port of the Graphite server to report to. prefix is prefix for Metric key names that are reported to the Graphite server.</description>

      <description>Prometheus Reaper exposes all its metrics in a Prometheus-ready format under the /prometheusMetrics endpoint on the admin port.
It&amp;rsquo;s fairly straightforward to configure Prometheus to grab them. The config can look something like:
scrape_configs: - job_name: &amp;#39;reaper&amp;#39; metrics_path: &amp;#39;/prometheusMetrics&amp;#39; scrape_interval: 5s static_configs: - targets: [&amp;#39;host.docker.internal:8081&amp;#39;]  The host.docker.internal tells a Prometheus instance running inside a docker container to connect to the host&amp;rsquo;s 8081 port where Raper runs from a JAR.  Metric Relabelling Reaper doesn&amp;rsquo;t do anything with the metrics.</description>

      Once successfully completed, the Cluster&amp;rsquo;s health will be displayed.
If JMX authentication is required and all clusters share the same credentials, they have to be filled in the Reaper YAML file, under jmxAuth (see the configuration reference).</description>

      <description>Monitoring Cassandra Diagnostic Events Reaper has the ability to listen and display live Cassandra&amp;rsquo;s emitted Diagnostic Events.
In Cassandra 4.0 internal system &amp;ldquo;diagnostic events&amp;rdquo; have become available, via the work done in CASSANDRA-12944. These allow to observe internal Cassandra events, for example in unit tests and with external tools. These diagnostic events provide operational monitoring and troubleshooting beyond logs and metrics.

      <description>Operating Multiple DCs using Multiple Reaper Multiple Reaper instances can operate clusters which have multi datacenter deployment. Multiple Reaper instances, also known as Distributed mode, can only be used when using the Apache Cassandra backend. Using multiple Reaper instances allows improved availability and fault tolerance. It is more likely that a Reaper UI is available via one of the Reaper instances, and that scheduled repairs are executed by one of the running Reaper instances.</description>

      <description>Sidecar Mode Sidecar Mode is a way of deploying Reaper for Apache Cassandra with one reaper instance for each node in the cluster. The name &amp;ldquo;Sidecar&amp;rdquo; comes from the Sidecar Pattern which describes a mechanism for co-locating an auxiliary service with its supported application. See also Design Patterns for Container-based Distributed Systems. It is a pattern that is often used in Kubernetes, where the main application and the sidecar application are deployed as separate containers in the same pod.</description>

      <description>Frequently Asked Questions Why use Reaper instead of nodetool + cron? While it&amp;rsquo;s possible to set up crontab to call nodetool, it requires staggering the crons to ensure overlap is kept to a minimum. Reaper is able to intelligently schedule repairs to avoid putting too much load on the cluster, avoiding impacting performance. Reaper also offers a simple UI to schedule repairs as granularly as needed.
Do I need to do repairs if I&amp;rsquo;m not deleting data?</description>
