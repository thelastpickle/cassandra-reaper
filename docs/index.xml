      <description>Enter an address of one of the nodes in the cluster, then click Add Cluster Reaper will contact that node and find the rest of the nodes in the cluster automatically.
      Once successfully completed, the Cluster&amp;rsquo;s health will be displayed.
If JMX authentication is required and all clusters share the same credentials, they have to be filled in the Reaper YAML file, under jmxAuth (see the configuration reference).</description>

      <description>To use in memory storage as the storage type for Reaper, the storageType setting must be set to memory in the Reaper configuration YAML file. Note that the in memory storage is enabled by default. An example of how to configure Reaper with In-Menory storage can be found in the cassandra-reaper-memory.yaml.
storageType: memory In-memory storage is volatile and as such all registered cluster, column families and repair information will be lost upon service restart.</description>

      <description>Upgrading from 1.2.0/1.2.1 to 1.2.2 We unfortunately had to break schema migrations for upgrades to 1.2.2 from 1.2.0 and 1.2.1. Here is the upgrade procedure for each Reaper backend:
Cassandra  Stop all Reaper instances Run the following DDL statement on the backend cluster :  ALTER TABLE reaper_db.repair_unit_v1 DROP repair_thread_count;  Upgrade Reaper to 1.2.2 and start it  Note: by doing so the number of threads for each existing schedule will revert back to 0, which will be translated to a single repair thread.</description>

      <description>Reaper practices forward merging commits.
Fixes and improvements required to release branches are first committed to those branches. These changes are merged forward onto master afterwards.
An example where a bugfix developed and approved for the release branch 1.4 is to be merged;
1. Rebase the work one last time off the release branch git checkout bob/1.4_bugfix git rebase 1.4 git push 2. Switch to the Release branch and fast-forward merge in the fix git checkout 1.</description>

      <description>Reaper can operate clusters which has a multi datacenter deployment. The datacenterAvailability setting in the Reaper YAML file indicates to Reaper its deployment in relation to cluster data center network locality.
Single Reaper instance with JMX accessible for all DCs In the case where the JMX port is accessible (with or without authentication) from the running Reaper instance for all nodes in all DCs, it is possible to have a single instance of Reaper handle one or multiple clusters by using the following setting in the configuration yaml file :</description>

      <description>Multiple Reaper instances can operate clusters which have multi datacenter deployment. Multiple Reaper instances, also known as Distributed mode, can only be used when using the Apache Cassandra backend. Using multiple Reaper instances allows improved availability and fault tolerance. It is more likely that a Reaper UI is available via one of the Reaper instances, and that scheduled repairs are executed by one of the running Reaper instances.
The datacenterAvailability setting in the Reaper YAML file indicates to Reaper its deployment in relation to cluster data center network locality.</description>

      <guid>http://cassandra-reaper.io/usage/sidecar_mode/</guid>
      <description>Sidecar Mode is a way of deploying Cassandra Reaper with one reaper instance for each node in the cluster. The name &amp;ldquo;Sidecar&amp;rdquo; comes from the Sidecar Pattern which describes a mechanism for co-locating an auxiliary service with its supported application. See also Design Patterns for Container-based Distributed Systems. It is a pattern that is often used in Kubernetes, where the main application and the sidecar application are deployed as separate containers in the same pod.</description>

      <guid>http://cassandra-reaper.io/configuration/authentication/</guid>
      <description>Authentication is activated in Reaper by default. It relies on Apache Shiro, which allows to store users and password in files, databases or connect through LDAP and Active Directory out of the box. The default authentication uses the dummy username and password as found in the default shiro.ini. It is expected you override this in a production environment.
This default Shiro authentication configuration is referenced via the following block in the Reaper yaml file :</description>

      <description>Source code for all the REST resources can be found from package io.cassandrareaper.resources.
Login Resource  POST /login  Expected form parameters:  username: User to login with as defined in Shiro settings (default user is admin) password: Password to authenticate with through Shiro (default password of user admin is: admin) rememberMe: Boolean to have the Web UI remember the username   Endpoint for logging in to Reaper    Shiro JWT Provider  GET /jwt  Expected query parameters: None Returns a JWT to use in all REST calls when authentication is turned on in Reaper.</description>

      <description>Reaper has the ability to listen and display live Cassandra&amp;rsquo;s emitted Diagnostic Events.
In Cassandra 4.0 internal system &amp;ldquo;diagnostic events&amp;rdquo; have become available, via the work done in CASSANDRA-12944. These allow to observe internal Cassandra events, for example in unit tests and with external tools. These diagnostic events provide operational monitoring and troubleshooting beyond logs and metrics.

      <guid>http://cassandra-reaper.io/faq/</guid>
      <description>Why use Reaper instead of noddetool + cron? While it&amp;rsquo;s possible to set up crontab to call nodetool, it requires staggering the crons to ensure overlap is kept to a minimum. Reaper is able to intelligently schedule repairs to avoid putting too much load on the cluster, avoiding impacting performance. Reaper also offers a simple UI to schedule repairs as granularly as needed.
Do I need to do repairs if I&amp;rsquo;m not deleting data?</description>
