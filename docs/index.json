	"content": "Dashboards There are many ways of visualising the metrics Reaper exposes. Here is just a few examples to get you started.\nWe are going to use Grafana to visualize metrics fetched from a Prometheus backed. We will also assume the metrics were relabeled.\nRepair progress One of the simplest things to visualize is repair progress. We can do that using a simple Gauge, where we use use the following query:\nio_cassandrareaper_service_RepairRunner_repairProgress To make the panel more pretty, we can enter the following in the Legend field:\n{{cluster}} - {{keyspace}} With two keyspaces doing repairs, we should see two dials, one for each keyspace:\nWe can now switch the Gauge visualisation for a Stat one, which will give us the repair progress, but also a small graph showing the progress over time:\nTo monitor the repair progress in terms of the number of repaired segments, we can use the following query:\nio_cassandrareaper_service_RepairRunner_segmentsDone Again, we put this query into the Stat panel, but we also select Last for the Calc field in the Display part of the Visualization tab. We should get a chart that looks like this:\nSegment duration When monitoring repairs, we would like to know how much time it takes to repair a segment. As a rule of thumb, we would like each segment to take 10 to 15 minutes. This indicates the segments are big enough to not waste the overhead of a repair session and minimise over-streaming, while not being too large to risk streaming timeouts.\nTo check segment durations, we will use the SegmentRunner_runRepair metric. This metric is a timer covering the duration from the moment a SegmentRunner wakes up to repair a segment until the segment finishes. In this case, we will use a Graph and feed it the following querry:\nio_cassandrareaper_service_SegmentRunner_repairing{quantile=\u0026#34;0.5\u0026#34;} Unlike previous examples, here we add a filter to explicitly pick the 0.5th percentile because we are interested in the majority of the segments, not just the longest ones. Reaper already gives us this duration in seconds, so we pick Seconds (s) as a Unit for the Left Y axis in the Axes section of the Visualization tab. We should end up with a graph that looks like this:\nWe see our segments are taking ~30 seconds, which is way below the desired ~10 minutes. We should tweak our repairs to use less segments.\nSegments per hour For the last two graphs, we\u0026rsquo;ll try something harder. We\u0026rsquo;ll try to plot the number of segments repaired per hour.\nWe create another Graph panel and feed it a query like this:\n(increase(io_cassandrareaper_service_RepairRunner_segmentsDone[1h])) The above simply means we ask Prometheus to give us the increase of the given metric in a 1 hour window.\nNext, we enter 1h as a Min step in the query tab (it\u0026rsquo;s next to the Legend field), and we set 24h as a Relative time. In the Visualization tab, we select to draw Bars and turn on stacking. We should end up with a graph like this:\nNote that the panel now says it tracks the last 24 hours in the top right corner - this is because of the relative time we selected. Also, even though it\u0026rsquo;s not obvious from the graph, Grafana will draw a bar only after that hour passes. In other words, you might need to wait a bit before you start to see your bars.\nSegments in the last hour Finally, we can also plot the number of segments repaired in the last hour only. We use the same query, min step and Relative time as before, but this time we put it into a Bar Gauge with a vertical orientation. We should see this:\n"

This provides high availability and allows to repair multi DC clusters.\nTo run Reaper using the Cassandra backend, create a reaper_db keyspace with an appropriate placement strategy. This is installation specific, and names of the data centers in the cluster that will host the Reaper data must be specified. For example:\nCREATE KEYSPACE reaper_db WITH replication = {\u0026#39;class\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;NetworkTopologyStrategy\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026lt;data_center\u0026gt;\u0026#39;: 3}; Where:\n\u0026lt;data_center\u0026gt; is the name of the Cassandra data center that will contain the keyspace replicas. When operating Reaper in a production environment, it is recommended that:\nAn RF (Replication Factor) of 3 be used in each data center for the reaper_db keyspace. This is to ensure that all Reaper state data is still available should a node in the cluster be unavailable. The NetworkTopologyStrategy should be used for the replication strategy of the keyspace. This is because LOCAL_* requests will fail if the SimpleNetworkingStrategy is used in an environment where there is more than one data center defined. Schema initialization and migration will be done automatically upon startup.\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s not possible for Cassandra nodes to broadcast addresses that will work for each and every client; for instance, they might broadcast private IPs because most clients are in the same network, but a particular client could be on another network and go through a router. For such cases, you can configure a custom address translator that will perform additional address translation based on configured mapping.\nstorageType: cassandra cassandra: clusterName: \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; contactPoints: [\u0026#34;node1.cassandra.reaper.io\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;node2.cassandra.reaper.io\u0026#34;] keyspace: reaper_db jmxAddressTranslator: type: multiIpPerNode ipTranslations: - from: \u0026#34;10.10.10.111\u0026#34; to: \u0026#34;node1.cassandra.reaper.io\u0026#34; - from: \u0026#34;10.10.10.112\u0026#34; to: \u0026#34;node2.cassandra.reaper.io\u0026#34; When running multi region clusters in AWS, set type to ec2MultiRegion in order to use the EC2MultiRegionAddressTranslator from the Datastax Java Driver.\n"

The value must be either ALL, LOCAL, EACH or SIDECAR. Note that this setting controls the behavior for metrics collection.\nBy default, Apache Cassandra restricts JMX communications to localhost only. In this setup, only the SIDECAR value is suitable.\nFor security reasons, it is possible that Reaper will have access limited to nodes in a single datacenter via JMX (multi region clusters for example). In this case, it is possible to deploy an operate an instance of Reaper in each datacenter where each instance only has access via JMX (with or without authentication) to the nodes in its local datacenter. In addition, Reaper will check the number of pending compactions and actively running repairs on all replicas prior to processing a segment.\nALL - requires Reaper to have access via JMX to all nodes across all datacenters. In this mode Reaper can be backed by all available storage types.\nLOCAL - requires Reaper to have access via JMX to all nodes only in the same datacenter local to Reaper. A single Reaper instance can operate in this mode and trigger repairs from within its local data center. In this case, can be backed by all available storage types and repairs to any remote datacenters are be handled internally by Cassandra. A Reaper instance can be deployed to each datacenter and be configured to operate in this mode. In this case, Reaper can use Apache Cassandra as its storage.\nFurther information can be found in the Operating with a Multi DC Cluster section.\nEACH - requires a minimum of one Reaper instance operating in each datacenter. Each Reaper instance is required to have access via JMX to all nodes only in its local datacenter. When operating in this mode, Reaper can use either of Apache Cassandra as its storage. In addition, metrics from nodes in remote datacenters must be collected through the storage backend.

If this timeout is reached, the repair segment in question will be cancelled, if possible, and then scheduled for later repair again within the same repair run process.\nhttpManagement Settings to configure HTTP management interface for integration with management APIs like DataStax OpsCenter or similar tools.\nhttpManagement: enabled: false mgmtApiMetricsPort: 9000 keystore: /path/to/keystore.jks truststore: /path/to/truststore.jks truststoresDir: /path/to/truststores enabled Type: Boolean\nDefault: false\nEnables or disables the HTTP management interface.\nmgmtApiMetricsPort Type: Integer\nDefault: 9000\nThe port number for the management API metrics endpoint.\nkeystore Type: String\nPath to the keystore file for SSL/TLS configuration of the management interface.\ntruststore Type: String\nPath to the truststore file for SSL/TLS configuration of the management interface.\ntruststoresDir Type: String\nDirectory path containing truststore files for SSL/TLS configuration.\nincrementalRepair Type: Boolean\nDefault: false\nSets the default repair type unless specifically defined for each run. Note that this is only supported with the PARALLEL repairParallelism setting. For more details in incremental repair, please refer to the following article.http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/more-efficient-repairs\nNote: It is recommended to avoid using incremental repair before Cassandra 4.0 as subtle bugs can lead to overstreaming and cluster instabililty.\nsubrangeIncrementalRepair Type: Boolean\nDefault: false\nSets the default repair type unless specifically defined for each run. Note that this is only supported with the PARALLEL repairParallelism setting. For more details in incremental repair, please refer to the following article.http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/more-efficient-repairs. This mode will split the repair jobs into sets of token ranges using the incremental mode. This will prevail over the incrementalRepair setting.\nNote: Subrange incremental repair is only available since Cassandra 4.0.\nblacklistTwcsTables Type: Boolean\nDefault: false\nDisables repairs of any tables that use either the TimeWindowCompactionStrategy or DateTieredCompactionStrategy. This automatic blacklisting is not stored in schedules or repairs. It is applied when repairs are triggered and visible in the UI for running repairs. Not storing which tables are TWCS/DTCS ensures changes to a table\u0026rsquo;s compaction strategy are honored on every new repair.\nNote: It is recommended to enable this option as repairing these tables, when they contain TTL\u0026rsquo;d data, causes overlaps between partitions across the configured time windows the sstables reside in. This leads to an increased disk usage as the older sstables are unable to be expired despite only containing TTL\u0026rsquo;s data.

Reaper for Apache Cassandra ships the Graphite and DataDog reporters by default.\nFurther information on metrics configuration can be found in the Metrics section.\nrepairIntensity Type: Float (value between 0.0 and 1.0, but must never be 0.0.)\nRepair intensity defines the amount of time to sleep between triggering each repair segment while running a repair run. When intensity is 1.0, it means that Reaper doesn\u0026rsquo;t sleep at all before triggering next segment, and otherwise the sleep time is defined by how much time it took to repair the last segment divided by the intensity value. 0.5 means half of the time is spent sleeping, and half running. Intensity 0.75 means that 25% of the total time is used sleeping and 75% running. This value can also be overwritten per repair run when invoking repairs.\nrepairManagerSchedulingIntervalSeconds Type: Integer\nDefault: 30\nControls the pace at which the Repair Manager will schedule processing of the next segment. Reducing this value from its default value of 30s to a lower value can speed up fast repairs by orders of magnitude.\nrepairParallelism Type: String\nType of parallelism to apply by default to repair runs. The value must be either SEQUENTIAL, PARALLEL, or DATACENTER_AWARE.\nSEQUENTIAL - one replica at a time, validation compaction performed on snapshots\nPARALLEL - all replicas at the same time, no snapshot\nDATACENTER_AWARE - one replica in each DC at the same time, with snapshots. If this value is used in clusters older than 2.0.12, Reaper will fall back into using SEQUENTIAL for those clusters.\nrepairRunThreadCount Type: Integer\nThe amount of threads to use for handling the Reaper tasks. Have this big enough not to cause blocking in cause some thread is waiting for I/O, like calling a Cassandra cluster through JMX.\nscheduleDaysBetween Type: Integer\nDefault: 7\nDefines the amount of days to wait between scheduling new repairs. The value configured here is the default for new repair schedules, but you can also define it separately for each new schedule. Using value 0 for continuous repairs is also supported.\nscheduleRetryOnError Type: Boolean\nDefault: false\nWhen enabled, repair schedules will be automatically retried if they fail due to errors. This can help with recovering from temporary failures or network issues.\nscheduleRetryDelay Type: String (ISO 8601 Duration)\nDefault: PT1H (1 hour)\nThe delay period before retrying a failed repair schedule. This setting only takes effect when scheduleRetryOnError is enabled.\nsegmentCountPerNode Type: Integer\nDefault: 64\nDefines the default amount of repair segments to create for newly registered Cassandra repair runs, for each node in the cluster. When running a repair run by Reaper, each segment is repaired separately by the Reaper process, until all the segments in a token ring are repaired. The count might be slightly off the defined value, as clusters residing in multiple data centers require additional small token ranges in addition to the expected. This value can be overwritten when executing a repair run via Reaper.\nIn a 10 nodes cluster, setting a value of 20 segments per node will generate a repair run that splits the work into 200 token subranges. This number can vary due to vnodes (before 1.2.0, Reaper cannot create a segment with multiple token ranges, so the number of segments will be at least the total number of vnodes in the cluster). As Reaper tries to size segments evenly, the presence of very small token ranges can lead to have more segments than expected.\npurgeRecordsAfterInDays Type: Integer\nDefault: 30\nDefines the amount of days after which a repair run will get purged from storage.\nserver Settings to configure the application UI server.\nserver: type: default applicationConnectors: - type: http port: 8080 bindHost: 0.0.0.0 adminConnectors: - type: http port: 8081 bindHost: 0.0.0.0 requestLog: appenders: [] Reaper provides two separate UIs; the application UI which is configured via the applicationConnectors settings and the administration UI which is configured via the adminConnectors settings. The application UI provides functionality to create/manage cluster schedules, and the administration UI provides tools for monitoring and debugging the Reaper system.\nport For the applicationConnectors this setting will be the port number used to access the application UI. For the adminConnectors this setting will be the port number to access the administration UI.\nNote that the port numbers for each must be different values when bound to the same host.\nbindHost For the applicationConnectors this setting will be the host address used to access the application UI. For the adminConnectors this setting will be the host address used to access the administration UI.\nNote that to bind the service to all interfaces use value 0.0.0.0 or leave the value for the setting this blank. A value of * is an invalid value for this setting.\nstorageType Type: String\nThe storage type to use in which Reaper will store its control data. The value must be either cassandra, astra or memory. If the recommended (persistent) storage type cassandra, or astra is being used, the database client parameters must be specified in the cassandra section in the configuration file. See the example settings in provided the src/packaging/resources directory of the repository.\nuseAddressTranslator Type: Boolean\nDefault: false\nWhen running multi region clusters in AWS, turn this setting to true in order to use the EC2MultiRegionAddressTranslator from the Datastax Java Driver. This will allow translating the public address that the nodes broadcast to the private IP address that is used to expose JMX.\njmxAddressTranslator Since 2.1.0\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s not possible for Cassandra nodes to broadcast addresses that will work for each and every client; for instance, they might broadcast private IPs because most clients are in the same network, but a particular client could be on another network and go through a router. For such cases, you can configure a custom address translator that will perform additional address translation based on configured mapping.\njmxAddressTranslator: type: multiIpPerNode ipTranslations: - from: \u0026#34;10.10.10.111\u0026#34; to: \u0026#34;node1.cassandra.reaper.io\u0026#34; - from: \u0026#34;10.10.10.112\u0026#34; to: \u0026#34;node2.cassandra.reaper.io\u0026#34; When running multi region clusters in AWS, set type to ec2MultiRegion in order to use the EC2MultiRegionAddressTranslator from the Datastax Java Driver. This will allow translating the public address that the nodes broadcast to the private IP address that is used to expose JMX.\naccessControl Settings to activate and configure authentication for the web UI and REST API. Deleting or commenting that block from the yaml file will turn off authentication.\naccessControl: enabled: true # Enable/disable authentication sessionTimeout: PT10M # Session timeout (ISO 8601 duration) jwt: secret: \u0026#34;your-jwt-secret-key\u0026#34; # JWT signing secret (minimum 256 bits) tokenExpirationTime: PT10M # JWT token expiration users: - username: \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;admin123\u0026#34; roles: [\u0026#34;operator\u0026#34;] - username: \u0026#34;user\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;user123\u0026#34; roles: [\u0026#34;user\u0026#34;] For detailed authentication configuration and security considerations, see the Authentication documentation.\nrepairThreadCount Type: Integer\nSince Cassandra 2.2, repairs are multithreaded in order to process several token ranges concurrently and speed up the process. This setting allows to set a default for automatic repair schedules. No more than four threads are allowed by Cassandra.\nmaxPendingCompactions Type: Integer\nDefault: 20\nReaper will prevent repair from overwhelming the cluster when lots of SSTables are streamed, by pausing segment processing if there are more than a specific number of pending compactions. Adjust this setting if you have a lot of tables in the cluster and the total number of pending compactions is usually high.\nmaxParallelRepairs Since 2.2.0\nType: Integer\nDefault: 2\nReaper allows concurrent segments from distinct repair runs running on the same nodes at the same time. In order to limit the repair load, it will only allow a limited number of repair runs to run concurrently (by default, two). Repair runs over the threshold will still start and be in RUNNING state, but their segments will be postposned as long as there are too many repairs being processed.\nSetting this value too high could put a lot of pressure on clusters and negatively impact their performance.\ncryptograph Optional settings to configure how confidential text (ie: passwords) are encyrpted/decrypted.\ncryptograph: type: symmetric systemPropertySecret: SOME_SYSTEM_PROPERTY_KEY type The encryption technique used when encrypting, decrypting, or validating confidential text. Symmetric encryption is the default.\nalgorithm Type: String\nDefault: PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512\nThe optional standard name of the requested secret-key algorithm. See the SecretKeyFactory section in the Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation for information about standard algorithm names.\ncipher Type: String\nDefault: AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding\nThe optional name of the transformation, e.g., AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding. See the Cipher section in the Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation for information about standard transformation names.\ncipherType Type: String\nDefault: AES\nThe optional name of the secret-key algorithm to be associated with the given key material. See Appendix A in the Java Cryptography Architecture Reference Guide for information about standard algorithm names.\niterationCount Type: Integer\nDefault: 1024\nThe optional number of times the password is hashed.\nkeyStrength Type: Integer\nDefault: 256\nThe optional length in bits of the derived symmetric key\nsalt Type: String\nDefault: deadbeef\nThe optional salt used for creating the PBEKeySpec\nsystemPropertySecret Type: String\nThe key of a system property that holds the shared secret for the symmetric encryption. If encrypted text is required, then this key and its value need to be defined in the environment before reaper can be started.\nexport SOME_SYSTEM_PROPERTY_KEY=mysharedsecret\n"

	"content": "Segments Reaper splits repair runs in segments. A segment is a subrange of tokens that fits entirely in one of the cluster token ranges. The minimum number of segments for a repair run is the number of token ranges in the cluster. With a 3 nodes cluster using 256 vnodes per node, a repair run will have at least 768 segments. If necessary, each repair can define a higher number of segments than the number of token ranges.\nAs of Reaper 1.2.0 and Apache Cassandra 2.2, token ranges that have the same replicas can be consolidated into a single segment. If the total number of requested segments is lower than the number of vnodes, Reaper will try to group token ranges so that each segment has the appropriate number of tokens. In Cassandra 2.2, one repair session will be started for each subrange of the segment, so the gain will be the reduction of overhead in Reaper. Starting with 3.0, Cassandra will generate a single repair session for all the subranges that share the same replicas, which then further reduces the overhead of vnodes in Cassandra.\nBack-pressure Reaper will associate each segment with its replicas, and run repairs sequentially on only one of the replicas. If a repair is already running on one of the replicas or if there are more than 20 pending compactions, Reaper will postpone the segment for future processing and try to repair the next segment.\nConcurrency and Multithreading Being a multi threaded service, Reaper will compute how many concurrent repair sessions can run on the cluster and adjust its thread pool accordingly. To that end, it will check the number of nodes in the cluster and the RF (Replication Factor) of the repaired keyspace. On a three node cluster with RF=3, only one segment can be repaired at a time. On a six node cluster with RF=3, two segments can be repaired at the same time.\nIn the case of a cluster spread around multiple datacenters, the number of concurrent repair will depend on the datacenter with the smallest RF by node. On a cluster composed of a main datacenter with 9 nodes and RF=3 and a backup datacenter with 4 nodes and RF=3, only one segment can be repaired at the same time because of the backup datacenter.\nThe maximum number of concurrent repairs is 15 by default and can be modified in the YAML configuration (cassandra-reaper.yaml) file.\nSince Cassandra 2.2, repairs are multithreaded in order to process several token ranges concurrently and speed up the process. No more than four threads are authorized by Cassandra. The number of repair threads can be set differently for each repair run/schedule. This setting will be ignored for clusters running an older version of Apache Cassandra.\nTimeout By default, each segment must complete within 30 minutes. Reaper subscribes to the repair service notifications of Cassandra to monitor completion, and if a segment takes more than 30 minutes it gets cancelled and postponed. This means that if a repair job is subject to frequent segment cancellation, it is necessary to either split it up into more segments or raise the timeout over its default value.\nPause and Resume Pausing a repair will force the termination of all running segments. Once the job is resumed, cancelled segments will be fully processed once again from the beginning.\nIntensity Intensity controls the eagerness by which Reaper triggers repair segments. The Reaper will use the duration of the previous repair segment to compute how much time to wait before triggering the next one. The idea behind this is that long segments mean a lot of data mismatch, and thus a lot of streaming and compaction. Intensity allows reaper to adequately back off and give the cluster time to handle the load caused by the repair.\nScheduling Interval Reaper polls for new segments to process at a fixed interval. By default the interval is set to 30 seconds and this value can be modified in the Reaper configuration YAML file.\n"

As soon as one table in the set of tables managed by this schedule gets over the threshold, the run will be triggered. After creating a scheduled repair, the page is updated with a list of active and paused repair schedules.\nNote that when choosing to add a new repair schedule, it is recommended to restrict the repair schedules to specific tables, instead of scheduling repairs for an entire keyspace. Creating different repair schedules will allow for simpler scheduling, fine-grain tuning for more valuable data, and easily grouping tables with smaller data load into different repair cycles.\nFor example, if there are certain tables that contain valuable data or a business requirement for high consistency and high availability, they could be schedule to be repaired during low traffic periods.\nNote that scheduled repairs can be paused and deleted by users with access to the Reaper web interface.

This provides a quick way to start Reaper and become familiar with its usage without the need of additional infrastructure. The environment created using Docker Compose comprises a single containerised Apache Cassandra node and a single containerised Reaper service.\nIn addition to the environment using Reaper\u0026rsquo;s default settings, Docker Compose services are provided that allow orchestration of an environment in which the connections between Reaper and Cassandra are SSL encrypted. The services which create this environment contain a -ssl suffix in their name.\nIt is also possible to automate registering the Cassandra cluster with Reaper and making Reaper start repairing non-system keyspaces automatically. To register a cluster, run the Reaper image with the register-cluster command:\nregister-clusters: image: cassandra-reaper:latest links: - cassandra - reaper-in-memory command: [\u0026#34;register-clusters\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cassandra:7199\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;reaper-in-memory\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;8080\u0026#34;] The register-clusters arguments are:\ncassandra:7199 - host and (JMX) port of a node in the cluster we want to register. reaper-in-memory - hostname of the Reaper instance. 8080 - the port on which Reaper listens on. To make Reaper automatically start repairs, make sure the following environment variables are set:\nREAPER_AUTO_SCHEDULING_ENABLED=\u0026#34;True\u0026#34; REAPER_AUTO_SCHEDULING_TIME_BEFORE_FIRST_SCHEDULE=\u0026#34;PT1M\u0026#34; REAPER_AUTO_SCHEDULING_PERIOD_BETWEEN_POLLS=\u0026#34;PT1M\u0026#34; All available Docker Compose services can be found in the docker-compose.yml file.\nDefault Settings Environment From the top level directory change to the src/packaging directory:\ncd src/packaging Start the Cassandra cluster:\ndocker-compose up cassandra The nodetool Docker Compose service can be used to check on the Cassandra node\u0026rsquo;s status:\ndocker-compose run nodetool status You can alternatively attach directly to the Cassandra container and run nodetool status from within it by running:\ndocker-compose exec cassandra /bin/bash Now that you have a bash shell in the container, you can run nodetool -u reaperUser -pwf /etc/cassandra/jmxremote.password.\nOnce the Cassandra node is online and accepting CQL connections, create the required reaper_db Cassandra keyspace to allow Reaper to save its cluster and scheduling data.\nBy default, the reaper_db keyspace is created using a replication factor of 1. To change this replication factor, provide the intended replication factor as an optional argument:\ndocker-compose run cqlsh-initialize-reaper_db [$REPLICATION_FACTOR] Wait a few moments for the reaper_db schema change to propagate, then start Reaper:\ndocker-compose up reaper SSL Encrypted Connections Environment From the top level directory change to the src/packaging directory:\ncd src/packaging Generate the SSL Keystore and Truststore which will be used to encrypt the connections between Reaper and Cassandra.\ndocker-compose run generate-ssl-stores Start the Cassandra cluster which encrypts both the JMX and Native Protocol:\ndocker-compose up cassandra-ssl The nodetool-ssl Docker Compose service can be used to check on the Cassandra node\u0026rsquo;s status:\ndocker-compose run nodetool-ssl status Once the Cassandra node is online and accepting encrypted SSL connections via the Native Transport protocol, create the required reaper_db Cassandra keyspace to allow Reaper to save its cluster and scheduling data.\nBy default, the reaper_db keyspace is created using a replication factor of 1.

	"description": "",
	"content": "Sidecar Mode is a way of deploying Reaper for Apache Cassandra with one reaper instance for each node in the cluster. The name \u0026ldquo;Sidecar\u0026rdquo; comes from the Sidecar Pattern which describes a mechanism for co-locating an auxiliary service with its supported application. See also Design Patterns for Container-based Distributed Systems. It is a pattern that is often used in Kubernetes, where the main application and the sidecar application are deployed as separate containers in the same pod.\nIn Sidecar Mode, each Cassandra node process is deployed alongside a Reaper process; Cassandra is the parent application and Reaper is the sidecar.\nGuidance Deploy one Reaper cluster per Cassandra cluster: Sidecar mode has been designed to allow you to easily deploy a separate, highly available Reaper service for each of your Cassandra clusters. You currently cannot use a Sidecar Mode Reaper service to manage multiple clusters. Deploy Reaper in a sidecar container alongside Cassandra: If you are using Kubernetes to deploy Cassandra and Reaper, put the Reaper process in the same Pod as Cassandra, in a sidecar container. See Pods that run multiple containers that need to work together Use Spreaper and the REST API for Reaper administration (use the WebUI for reporting): If you have automated the deployment of Reaper in Sidecar Mode alongside a Cassandra Cluster (described above). Clusters in sidecar mode are self registered into Reaper, and you can turn on auto-scheduling to fully automate Reaper setup. Use or write an operator: For example, you could write a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (e.g. a Cassandra resource) which contains configuration fields for the Cassandra database and fields with which you can define the Reaper repair settings. Then write an accompanying Kubernetes Operator which watches for changes to those resources and reconciles the declared (desired) configuration with the actual state of the Cassandra cluster and its Reaper service. Caveats One Reaper cluster per Cassandra Cluster: Sidecar Mode is designed to be used in situations where you deploy a separate Reaper cluster for every Cassandra cluster. If you prefer to deploy a single Reaper cluster to manage multiple Cassandra clusters then Sidecar Mode may not be suitable for you. High Resource Usage: In Sidecar Mode you will be deploying an additional Java process alongside each Cassandra process. If your underlying infrastructure has limited resources, then Sidecar Mode may not be suitable for you. WebUI Session Affinity: In Sidecar Mode, you will be able to connect to the Web based administration pages of any Reaper process in the cluster. But even once you have logged into the Web UI of one Reaper process, you will not be able to log into the Web UI on other Reaper processes. The Web UI session information is not stored in the underlying Cassandra Backend database. You will need to setup a loadbalancer / service that ensures that all Web UI traffic from a particular client is directed to a particular Reaper process. Snapshot support: In Sidecar Mode, snapshot are not supported as Reaper currently tries to connect to all nodes directly for that feature. "

This approach allows you to:\nAlways configure the primary admin user via REAPER_AUTH_USER and REAPER_AUTH_PASSWORD (required) Optionally configure a read-only user by setting both REAPER_READ_USER and REAPER_READ_USER_PASSWORD environment variables How It Works The read-only user is configured dynamically at container startup:\nIf both REAPER_READ_USER and REAPER_READ_USER_PASSWORD are set to non-empty values, a read-only user with the [\u0026quot;user\u0026quot;] role is automatically added to the configuration If either variable is empty or unset, no read-only user is configured This prevents environment variable resolution errors while maintaining security Benefits No mandatory unused environment variables: You don\u0026rsquo;t need to set empty values for unused users Flexible deployment: Same Docker image can be used with or without read-only users Security by default: Empty or missing credentials don\u0026rsquo;t create weak authentication points User Roles Reaper implements role-based access control with two main roles:\nuser Role Read-only access to all resources Can view clusters, repair runs, schedules, and metrics Cannot create, modify, or delete resources Suitable for monitoring and reporting users operator Role Full access to all resources Can create, modify, and delete clusters, repair runs, and schedules Can trigger repairs and manage all Reaper functionality Suitable for administrators and operational users Environment Variable Configuration For production deployments, especially with Docker, use environment variables instead of hardcoded values:\naccessControl: enabled: ${REAPER_AUTH_ENABLED:-true} sessionTimeout: ${REAPER_SESSION_TIMEOUT:-PT10M} jwt: secret: \u0026#34;${JWT_SECRET:-MySecretKeyForJWTWhichMustBeLongEnoughForHS256Algorithm}\u0026#34; users: - username: \u0026#34;${REAPER_AUTH_USER}\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;${REAPER_AUTH_PASSWORD}\u0026#34; roles: [\u0026#34;operator\u0026#34;] # Additional read-only user is configured automatically if REAPER_READ_USER # and REAPER_READ_USER_PASSWORD environment variables are set Docker Configuration Environment Variables When running Reaper in Docker, set these environment variables:\n# Authentication control REAPER_AUTH_ENABLED=true # JWT Configuration JWT_SECRET=\u0026#34;your-production-jwt-secret-key-here\u0026#34; # Admin user credentials - REQUIRED when authentication is enabled REAPER_AUTH_USER=\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34; REAPER_AUTH_PASSWORD=\u0026#34;your-secure-admin-password-here\u0026#34; # Read-only user credentials - OPTIONAL (only configured if both are set) REAPER_READ_USER=\u0026#34;monitoring\u0026#34; REAPER_READ_USER_PASSWORD=\u0026#34;your-secure-monitoring-password-here\u0026#34; # Session timeout REAPER_SESSION_TIMEOUT=\u0026#34;PT30M\u0026#34; ⚠️ Important: You must set REAPER_AUTH_USER and REAPER_AUTH_PASSWORD, or Reaper will fail to start.

	"content": "Frequently Asked Questions Why use Reaper instead of nodetool + cron? While it\u0026rsquo;s possible to set up crontab to call nodetool, it requires staggering the crons to ensure overlap is kept to a minimum. Reaper is able to intelligently schedule repairs to avoid putting too much load on the cluster, avoiding impacting performance. Reaper also offers a simple UI to schedule repairs as granularly as needed.\nDo I need to do repairs if I\u0026rsquo;m not deleting data? Yes! Repair is a necessary anti-entropy mechanism that keeps your cluster consistent. Without repair, queries at LOCAL_ONE could return incorrect results.\nWhich backend is used to store Reaper\u0026rsquo;s data? When we (The Last Pickle) took over development of Reaper, we found it cumbersome to require a PostGres database in addition to the Cassandra database. We also knew Reaper would need to be fault tolerant and work across datacenters. The most straightforward way to do this would be to leverage Cassandra\u0026rsquo;s fault tolerance.\nPostgres and H2 were removed starting with v3.0.0 in order to simplify the codebase and feature addition. The memory backend is still available for testing purposes.\n"
