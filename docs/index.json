	"content": "Cassandra Reaper Overview Reaper is an open source tool that aims to schedule and orchestrate repairs of Apache Cassandra clusters.\nIt improves the existing nodetool repair process by\n Splitting repair jobs into smaller tunable segments. Handling back-pressure through monitoring running repairs and pending compactions. Adding ability to pause or cancel repairs and track progress precisely.  Reaper ships with a REST API, a command line tool and a web UI.\nThis documentation includes instructions on how build, install, and configure Reaper correctly.\nCompatibility Reaper supports all versions of Apache Cassandra ranging from 1.2 to 3.11. Incremental repair is supported for versions from 2.1 and above.\nA single instance of Reaper can handle repairs for clusters running different Apache Cassandra versions.\nDownload and Install Head over to the Downloads section to download the version of Reaper that is compatible with your system.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "Segments Reaper splits repair runs in segments. A segment is a subrange of tokens that fits entirely in one of the cluster token ranges. The minimum number of segments for a repair run is the number of token ranges in the cluster. With a 3 nodes cluster using 256 vnodes per node, a repair run will have at least 768 segments. If necessary, each repair can define a higher number of segments than the number of token ranges.\nAs of Reaper 1.2.0 and Apache Cassandra 2.2, token ranges that have the same replicas can be consolidated into a single segment. If the total number of requested segments is lower than the number of vnodes, Reaper will try to group token ranges so that each segment has the appropriate number of tokens. In Cassandra 2.2, one repair session will be started for each subrange of the segment, so the gain will be the reduction of overhead in Reaper. Starting with 3.0, Cassandra will generate a single repair session for all the subranges that share the same replicas, which then further reduces the overhead of vnodes in Cassandra.\nBack-pressure Reaper will associate each segment with its replicas, and run repairs sequentially on only one of the replicas. If a repair is already running on one of the replicas or if there are more than 20 pending compactions, Reaper will postpone the segment for future processing and try to repair the next segment.\nConcurrency and Multithreading Being a multi threaded service, Reaper will compute how many concurrent repair sessions can run on the cluster and adjust its thread pool accordingly. To that end, it will check the number of nodes in the cluster and the RF (Replication Factor) of the repaired keyspace. On a three node cluster with RF=3, only one segment can be repaired at a time. On a six node cluster with RF=3, two segments can be repaired at the same time.\nThe maximum number of concurrent repairs is 15 by default and can be modified in the YAML configuration (cassandra-reaper.yaml) file.\nSince Cassandra 2.2, repairs are multithreaded in order to process several token ranges concurrently and speed up the process. No more than four threads are authorized by Cassandra. The number of repair threads can be set differently for each repair run/schedule. This setting will be ignored for clusters running an older version of Apache Cassandra.\nTimeout By default, each segment must complete within 30 minutes. Reaper subscribes to the repair service notifications of Cassandra to monitor completion, and if a segment takes more than 30 minutes it gets cancelled and postponed. This means that if a repair job is subject to frequent segment cancellation, it is necessary to either split it up into more segments or raise the timeout over its default value.\nPause and Resume Pausing a repair will force the termination of all running segments. Once the job is resumed, cancelled segments will be fully processed once again from the beginning.\nIntensity Intensity controls the eagerness by which Reaper triggers repair segments. The Reaper will use the duration of the previous repair segment to compute how much time to wait before triggering the next one. The idea behind this is that long segments mean a lot of data mismatch, and thus a lot of streaming and compaction. Intensity allows reaper to adequately back off and give the cluster time to handle the load caused by the repair.\nScheduling Interval Reaper polls for new segments to process at a fixed interval. By default the interval is set to 30 seconds and this value can be modified in the Reaper configuration YAML file.\n"

The value must be either ALL, LOCAL, EACH or SIDECAR. Note that this setting controls the behavior for metrics collection.\nBy default, Apache Cassandra restricts JMX communications to localhost only. In this setup, only the SIDECAR value is suitable.\nFor security reasons, it is possible that Reaper will have access limited to nodes in a single datacenter via JMX (multi region clusters for example). In this case, it is possible to deploy an operate an instance of Reaper in each datacenter where each instance only has access via JMX (with or without authentication) to the nodes in its local datacenter. In addition, Reaper will check the number of pending compactions and actively running repairs on all replicas prior to processing a segment.\nALL - requires Reaper to have access via JMX to all nodes across all datacenters. In this mode Reaper can be backed by all available storage types.\nLOCAL - requires Reaper to have access via JMX to all nodes only in the same datacenter local to Reaper. A single Reaper instance can operate in this mode and trigger repairs from within its local data center. In this case, can be backed by all available storage types and repairs to any remote datacenters are be handled internally by Cassandra. A Reaper instance can be deployed to each datacenter and be configured to operate in this mode. In this case, Reaper can use either of Apache Cassandra or Postgres as its storage.\nFurther information can be found in the Operating with a Multi DC Cluster section.\nEACH - requires a minimum of one Reaper instance operating in each datacenter. Each Reaper instance is required to have access via JMX to all nodes only in its local datacenter. When operating in this mode, Reaper can use either of Apache Cassandra or Postgres as its storage. In addition, metrics from nodes in remote datacenters must be collected through the storage backend. If any metric is unavailable, the segment will be postponed for later processing.\nFurther information can be found in the Operating with a Multi DC Cluster section.\nSIDECAR - requires one reaper instance for each node in the cluster. Each Reaper instance is required to have access via JMX to its local node. When operating in this mode, Reaper can use either of Apache Cassandra or Postgres as its storage.\nFurther information can be found in the Sidecar Mode section.\nenableCrossOrigin Type: Boolean\nDefault: true\nOptional setting which can be used to enable the CORS headers for running an external GUI application, like this project.

If this timeout is reached, the repair segment in question will be cancelled, if possible, and then scheduled for later repair again within the same repair run process.\nincrementalRepair Type: Boolean\nDefault: false\nSets the default repair type unless specifically defined for each run. Note that this is only supported with the PARALLEL repairParallelism setting. For more details in incremental repair, please refer to the following article.http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/more-efficient-repairs\nNote: It is recommended to avoid using incremental repair before Cassandra 4.0 as subtle bugs can lead to overstreaming and cluster instabililty.\nblacklistTwcsTables Type: Boolean\nDefault: false\nDisables repairs of any tables that use either the TimeWindowCompactionStrategy or DateTieredCompactionStrategy. This automatic blacklisting is not stored in schedules or repairs. It is applied when repairs are triggered and visible in the UI for running repairs. Not storing which tables are TWCS/DTCS ensures changes to a table\u0026rsquo;s compaction strategy are honored on every new repair.\nNote: It is recommended to enable this option as repairing these tables, when they contain TTL\u0026rsquo;d data, causes overlaps between partitions across the configured time windows the sstables reside in. This leads to an increased disk usage as the older sstables are unable to be expired despite only containing TTL\u0026rsquo;s data. Repairing DTCS tables has additional issues and is generally not recommended.\njmxAuth Optional setting to allow Reaper to establish JMX connections to Cassandra clusters using password based JMX authentication.\njmxAuth: username: cassandra password: cassandra #### `username`  username Type: String\nCassandra JMX username.\npassword Type: String\nCassandra JMX password.\njmxCredentials Since 1.1.0 Optional setting to allow Reaper to establish JMX connections to Cassandra clusters with specific credentials per cluster.\njmxCredentials: clusterProduction1: username: user1 password: password1 clusterProduction2: username: user2 password: password2  This setting can be used in conjunction with the jmxAuth to override the credentials for specific clusters only. The cluster name must match the one defined in the cassandra.yaml file (in the example above, clusterProduction1 and clusterProduction2).\nAdding a new cluster with specific credentials requires to add the seed node in the following format : host@cluster To match the example above, it could be something like : 10.0.10.5@clusterProduction1\njmxConnectionTimeoutInSeconds Type: Integer\nDefault: 20\nControls the timeout for establishing JMX connections.

Cassandra Reaper ships the Graphite and DataDog reporters by default.\nFurther information on metrics configuration can be found in the Metrics section.\nrepairIntensity Type: Float (value between 0.0 and 1.0, but must never be 0.0.)\nRepair intensity defines the amount of time to sleep between triggering each repair segment while running a repair run. When intensity is 1.0, it means that Reaper doesn\u0026rsquo;t sleep at all before triggering next segment, and otherwise the sleep time is defined by how much time it took to repair the last segment divided by the intensity value. 0.5 means half of the time is spent sleeping, and half running. Intensity 0.75 means that 25% of the total time is used sleeping and 75% running. This value can also be overwritten per repair run when invoking repairs.\nrepairManagerSchedulingIntervalSeconds Type: Integer\nDefault: 30\nControls the pace at which the Repair Manager will schedule processing of the next segment. Reducing this value from its default value of 30s to a lower value can speed up fast repairs by orders of magnitude.\nrepairParallelism Type: String\nType of parallelism to apply by default to repair runs. The value must be either SEQUENTIAL, PARALLEL, or DATACENTER_AWARE.\nSEQUENTIAL - one replica at a time, validation compaction performed on snapshots\nPARALLEL - all replicas at the same time, no snapshot\nDATACENTER_AWARE - one replica in each DC at the same time, with snapshots. If this value is used in clusters older than 2.0.12, Reaper will fall back into using SEQUENTIAL for those clusters.\nrepairRunThreadCount Type: Integer\nThe amount of threads to use for handling the Reaper tasks. Have this big enough not to cause blocking in cause some thread is waiting for I/O, like calling a Cassandra cluster through JMX.\nscheduleDaysBetween Type: Integer\nDefault: 7\nDefines the amount of days to wait between scheduling new repairs. The value configured here is the default for new repair schedules, but you can also define it separately for each new schedule. Using value 0 for continuous repairs is also supported.\nsegmentCountPerNode Type: Integer\nDefault: 16\nDefines the default amount of repair segments to create for newly registered Cassandra repair runs, for each node in the cluster. When running a repair run by Reaper, each segment is repaired separately by the Reaper process, until all the segments in a token ring are repaired. The count might be slightly off the defined value, as clusters residing in multiple data centers require additional small token ranges in addition to the expected. This value can be overwritten when executing a repair run via Reaper.\nIn a 10 nodes cluster, setting a value of 20 segments per node will generate a repair run that splits the work into 200 token subranges. This number can vary due to vnodes (before 1.2.0, Reaper cannot create a segment with multiple token ranges, so the number of segments will be at least the total number of vnodes in the cluster). As Reaper tries to size segments evenly, the presence of very small token ranges can lead to have more segments than expected.\nserver Settings to configure the application UI server.\nserver: type: default applicationConnectors: - type: http port: 8080 bindHost: 0.0.0.0 adminConnectors: - type: http port: 8081 bindHost: 0.0.0.0 requestLog: appenders: []  Reaper provides two separate UIs; the application UI which is configured via the applicationConnectors settings and the administration UI which is configured via the adminConnectors settings.

A value of * is an invalid value for this setting.\nstorageType Type: String\nThe storage type to use in which Reaper will store its control data. The value must be either cassandra, h2, memory, or postgres. If the recommended (persistent) storage type cassandra, h2, or postgres is being used, the database client parameters must be specified in the respective cassandra, h2, or postgres section in the configuration file. See the example settings in provided the src/packaging/resources directory of the repository.\nuseAddressTranslator Type: Boolean\nDefault: false\nWhen running multi region clusters in AWS, turn this setting to true in order to use the EC2MultiRegionAddressTranslator from the Datastax Java Driver. This will allow translating the public address that the nodes broadcast to the private IP address that is used to expose JMX.\naccessControl Settings to activate and configure authentication for the web UI.

Multiple Reaper instances, also known as Distributed mode, can only be used when using the Apache Cassandra backend. Using multiple Reaper instances allows improved availability and fault tolerance.

This is because the JMX metrics (pending compactions, running repairs) required for backpressure is not available from those remote nodes.\nIf multiple clusters are registered in Reaper it is required that some Reaper instances can access all the nodes in at least one of the datacenters in each of the registered clusters.\nLOCAL mode allows you to register multiple clusters in a distributed Reaper installation.

Where latency of requests and availability of nodes takes precedence over scheduled repairs this is the safest setup in Reaper.\nThere must be installed and running a Reaper instance in every datacenter of every registered Cassandra cluster.

	"title": "Sidecar Mode",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Sidecar Mode is a way of deploying Cassandra Reaper with one reaper instance for each node in the cluster. The name \u0026ldquo;Sidecar\u0026rdquo; comes from the Sidecar Pattern which describes a mechanism for co-locating an auxiliary service with its supported application. See also Design Patterns for Container-based Distributed Systems. It is a pattern that is often used in Kubernetes, where the main application and the sidecar application are deployed as separate containers in the same pod.\nIn Sidecar Mode, each Cassandra node process is deployed alongside a Reaper process; Cassandra is the parent application and Reaper is the sidecar.\nAdvantages  Security: Each Reaper process only needs local JMX access. No need to configure remote JMX access and JMX authentication. Kubernetes Friendly: Sidecar mode is very easy to setup if your Cassandra Cluster is deployed using a container orchestration system, such as Kubernetes.  Guidance  Deploy one Reaper cluster per Cassandra cluster: Sidecar mode has been designed to allow you to easily deploy a separate, highly available Reaper service for each of your Cassandra clusters. You currently cannot use a Sidecar Mode Reaper service to manage multiple clusters. Deploy Reaper in a sidecar container alongside Cassandra: If you are using Kubernetes to deploy Cassandra and Reaper, put the Reaper process in the same Pod as Cassandra, in a sidecar container. See Pods that run multiple containers that need to work together Use Spreaper and the REST API for Reaper administration (use the WebUI for reporting): If you have automated the deployment of Reaper in Sidecar Mode alongside a Cassandra Cluster (described above). Clusters in sidecar mode are self registered into Reaper, and you can turn on auto-scheduling to fully automate Reaper setup. Use or write an operator: For example, you could write a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (e.g. a Cassandra resource) which contains configuration fields for the Cassandra database and fields with which you can define the Reaper repair settings. Then write an accompanying Kubernetes Operator which watches for changes to those resources and reconciles the declared (desired) configuration with the actual state of the Cassandra cluster and its Reaper service.  Caveats  One Reaper cluster per Cassandra Cluster: Sidecar Mode is designed to be used in situations where you deploy a separate Reaper cluster for every Cassandra cluster. If you prefer to deploy a single Reaper cluster to manage multiple Cassandra clusters then Sidecar Mode may not be suitable for you. Container orchestration (Kubernetes) preferred: Following on from the \u0026ldquo;one-reaper-per-cluster\u0026rdquo; caveat (above) it is also worth noting that it is easiest to deploy Reaper in Sidecar Mode if your Cassandra cluster is managed by a container orchestration system, such as Kubernetes. Kubernetes ensures that the Reaper process starts and dies with the Cassandra process. Kubernetes also ensures that the Reaper process shares a network namespace with the Cassandra process so that it (and only it) can access the JMX service. High Resource Usage: In Sidecar Mode you will be deploying an additional Java process alongside each Cassandra process. If your underlying infrastructure has limited resources, then Sidecar Mode may not be suitable for you. WebUI Session Affinity: In Sidecar Mode, you will be able to connect to the Web based administration pages of any Reaper process in the cluster. But even once you have logged into the Web UI of one Reaper process, you will not be able to log into the Web UI on other Reaper processes. The Web UI session information is not stored in the underlying Cassandra Backend database. You will need to setup a loadbalancer / service that ensures that all Web UI traffic from a particular client is directed to a particular Reaper process. Snapshot support: In Sidecar Mode, snapshot are not supported as Reaper currently tries to connect to all nodes directly for that feature. Asynchronous orchestration of such tasks is planned for a future release.  "

	"content": "Why use Reaper instead of noddetool + cron? While it\u0026rsquo;s possible to set up crontab to call nodetool, it requires staggering the crons to ensure overlap is kept to a minimum. Reaper is able to intelligently schedule repairs to avoid putting too much load on the cluster, avoiding impacting performance. Reaper also offers a simple UI to schedule repairs as granularly as needed.\nDo I need to do repairs if I\u0026rsquo;m not deleting data? Yes! Repair is a necessary anti-entropy mechanism that keeps your cluster consistent. Without repair, queries at LOCAL_ONE could return incorrect results.\nWhy are there four backends? Which should i use? When we (The Last Pickle) took over development of Reaper, we found it cumbersome to require a PostGres database in addition to the Cassandra database. We also knew Reaper would need to be fault tolerant and work across datacenters. The most straightforward way to do this would be to leverage Cassandra\u0026rsquo;s fault tolerance.\nFor small setups, using a local DB (H2) can make sense. This would allow reaper to run on a single node using EBS for storage. This is intentionally a very simple design to keep costs down and avoid extra operational work.\nFor new installations, we\u0026rsquo;re recommending the Cassandra backend as it allows the most flexibility, with the highest level of availability.\n"
